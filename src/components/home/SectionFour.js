          APR Range
        </h2>
        <p>
          Fast Approved Loan is not a lender and does not have the ability to disclose exact APR. Consumers who originated via a paid Google advertisement feature rates on Loansmee.net of a minimum of 4.95% APR to a maximum of 34.95% APR (calculated consistent with the Truth in Lending Act, TILA) with repayment terms from 61 days to 72 months. This number will be set by your lender and you will be notified of the final number before accepting the loan terms. Annual percentage rates can vary based on both: 1) the information that you supply in your initial loan request, and 2) the information that your lender supplies to you.
          Rates based on creditworthiness and are subject to change without notice. Your actual rate and monthly payment may vary. Must be 18 years of age or older to request. Loansmee.net does refer consumers to trusted professional lenders who can provide loan information and assistance. There is no charge for our service. Once your request has been submitted and if approved, you shall be presented with the loan offer agreement. Lenders will disclose all details related to the loan — including APR, loan finance charges, or any other loan terms you would be agreeing to. We recommend to all users to carefully read and review the loan terms of any offer you receive. If you still have questions related to APR or loan related services, please contact us for more assistance.

Representative 18.23% APR.

          Financial Implications (Interest & Finance Charges)
        </h2>

        <p>
          Fast Approved Loan is not a lender, and we cannot predict what fees and interest rates will be applied to the loan you will be offered. It is your lender that will provide all the necessary information about the cost of the loan before you get approved. You are responsible for perusing the loan agreement carefully and accepting the offer only if you agree to all the terms. Loansmee.net service is free of charge, and you are under no obligation to accept the terms that the lender offers you.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl py-5 font-bold'>
          Implications of Non-Payment
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you accept the terms and conditions for a loan, you enter into a commitment to repay the amount you owe, according to the specific schedule outlined in the documents. In the event of non-payment, additional charges may be applied. Late payment penalties vary by lender, and as Loansmee.net is not involved in the lending process, we cannot supply any information on the fees you will incur if any disruptions occur. For more information, please contact the lender directly if you have any issues related to your loan repayment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please carefully review the late, partial, and non-payment policies that your lender provides with your loan agreement. Fast Approved loan works hard to partner with only the most trustworthy and reputable lenders who pursue the collection of past-due loan accounts in a fair and reasonable manner.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl py-5 font-bold'>
          Potential Impact to Credit Score
        </h2>
        <p>
          Fast Approved Loan is not a lender, and we do not check your credit standing and credit capacity. When you submit a request on our online platform, this is considered a soft inquiry and does not impact your credit score. However, some lenders may carry out a credit check to ascertain your eligibility for a loan. They will most likely turn to one of the three major credit bureaus: Transunion, Experian, or Equifax. When the lender inquires about your credit via these platforms, that inquiry will be considered a hard inquiry, affecting your credit score.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl py-5 font-bold'>
          Collection Practices
        </h2>
        <p>
          Fast Approved Loan is not a lender and, because of this, we have NO involvement in the debt collection process. As part of the lending agreement provided to you by the lender, they will disclose their debt collection practices. If you have any collection questions, please contact the lender for complete details. Loansmee.net only works with reputable lenders who use fair collection practices.
