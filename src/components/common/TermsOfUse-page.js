          Loan Inquiry Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our company retains the right to reject your loan inquiry at any time and for any lawful reason. Additional information or verification may be requested before your loan request is accepted. When you submit your information through a form on our website, you will be connected with a lender for further evaluation based on their respective policies and procedures. This, however, does not indicate that your loan has been approved. The decision to approve or deny your loan rests solely with the lender. Our company is not responsible for processing, approving, or rejecting your loan request. By submitting your information, you agree that if we are unable to find a lender who can provide the type of loan you initially requested, we will search our network of lenders to explore alternative loan products from different providers in order to assist you.
