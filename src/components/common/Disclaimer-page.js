                    Our company does not engage in lending activities, loan approval or denial, or credit decision-making. We operate solely as a marketplace service and do not act as a representative, agent, or correspondent for any lenders or service providers. We do not endorse any specific lenders, loan products, or service providers. You are not obligated to use our service to initiate contact, apply for credit, or accept any loan product from any lender or service provider. Please note that our service may not be available in all states.

                    Participating lenders may verify your social security number, driver's license number, or other federal and state identification, as well as assess your creditworthiness through national databases that include Equifax, TransUnion, Experian, and other credit bureaus. By submitting your information to us, you consent to lenders obtaining credit reports and verifying your information.

                    There is no fee for submitting a loan request through our platform. Our company does not provide lending services; instead, we leverage our extensive network of authorized lenders to find a potential match for your needs.

                    Once your information is shared with an authorized lender, they will evaluate it and potentially approve a loan for you. If approved, you will be redirected to an e-signature page on the lender's website. The lender should disclose all applicable fees and rate information at that time. It is crucial that you carefully review the rates and fees presented by the lender before accepting the loan or signing any documents. You are not obligated to accept terms that make you uncomfortable, and you should avoid terms that include payment amounts that are unmanageable or impossible for you to meet.

                    If you find the loan terms provided by the lender acceptable and wish to proceed, you may electronically sign the document. By doing so, you enter into a legally binding contract with the lender and assume responsibility for repaying the loan. Any repayment obligations or concerns specific to the loan should be addressed directly between you and the lender.

                    Please note that cash advances are designed as short-term financial relief and should not be considered as long-term financial solutions. If you are experiencing debt or credit difficulties, it is advisable to seek professional financial counseling.
